        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      </figcaption>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup mini chocolate chips</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>
          In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar,
          and brown sugar until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Add the vanilla extract and egg, mixing well.</li>
        <li>
          In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until
          just combined.
        </li>
        <li>Fold in the mini chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>
          Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets,
          spacing them about 2 inches apart.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake for 8-10 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. The centers
          will look soft but will firm up as they cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before
          transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
